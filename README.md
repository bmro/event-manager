# Event Manager

## Planning

1. User registers a new event.
 - [X] Create backend to accept a new event
 - [X] Define api to register a new event POST /api/events (name and date)
   - [X]Logs the event instead of saving to the DB
 - [ ] Create front-end app to make the new event 
 - [ ] Create form to submit a new event (name and date)
 - [ ] Dockerize the frontend and backend.
 - [ ] Add connection to MySQL
   - Persist the created event
